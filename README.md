# Subnational Inequality 
Organization for Fall '23 CPW paper 

If you’re a workshop participant, thanks for reading! The most important files for the paper are:
 1) The Python script that joins and cleans the data from LIS with the electoral data, which can be found at: scripts/data_processing/multi_join.py and 
 2) the R Markdown document where the models are run and the tables and visualizations are made, at: scripts/analysis/multi_country_analysis.Rmd.
   
All the data is here, so if you have any desire to play around with it you should be able to after cloning the repo (though I have probably been sloppy with a filepath or two, so you’ll have to fix that).
